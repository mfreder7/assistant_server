# assistant_server

The node server for interfacing and handling the GPT assistant schema. This project pairs with the frontend implementation available here: [Modular LLM Assistant Marketplace (Unfinished Project)](https://github.com/mfreder7/Modular-LLM-Assistant-Marketplace-Unfinished-Project-).

This project demonstrates how to interface with GPT-based LLMs and provides a starting point for building your own assistant systems.

## Features

- Built with **Node.js** for flexible and robust server-side logic.
- API integrations for AI-powered scheduling, location services, health, and more.
- Streamlined for modular LLM assistant development.
